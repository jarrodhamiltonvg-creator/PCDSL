The Parent-Child Digital Safety Link (PCDSL) Framework
This repository contains the full policy proposal and supporting materials for the â€˜Parent-Child Digital Safety Linkâ€™, a practical, parent-led alternative to the Australian Government's flawed social media ban for under-16s.

The Problem: A Flawed Approach to Online Safety
The current Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Act enforces a blanket ban that is not only easy for children to circumvent but also creates a significant privacy risk for all Australians. Its biggest flaw is that it forces every single person in Australiaâ€”adults, kids, and even touristsâ€”to hand over their sensitive ID to tech giants just to use an app.

This approach replaces parental responsibility with a blunt government mandate, and it won't work.

The Solution: Empowering Parents with Real Tools
The PCDSL framework is a sophisticated safety system, not a simple prohibition. It is a secure, opt-in public-private partnership that gives parents the choice to supervise their children's online activity effectively.

The core of the framework is a central, secure government hub (linked to myGov) where parents can register their child's devices. Online platforms are then required to check this hub and automatically apply a standardized set of robust parental controls to any account used on that device.

This is about giving parents the right tools for the job, not having the government do a poor job of parenting for everyone.
